 There are some HL7 version 3 based projects that don't have a published set of MIFs - they only have normative XML schema. 
 These projects mostly date from the early days of HL7 version 3, when MIF had not established itself as the metamodel expression used for HL7 version 3.

<!-- 
<pre><m>
END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR FHIR CONNECTOR EXTENSION SOFTWARE
IMPORTANT--READ CAREFULLY: This End-User License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal contract between you (either an individual or a single business entity)

associated media, printed materials, and "online" or electronic documentation (the "Software").

BY CLICKING THE [ENTER] OR [ACCEPTED] ICON BELOW, OR BY INSTALLING, COPYING, OR OTHERWISE USING THE SOFTWARE, 
YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS, LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY 
AND TERMINATION PROVISIONS BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT INSTALL OR USE THE SOFTWARE, AND EXIT NOW.

Background
QSI has produced a computer program for its own use and for the use of interested customers providing users an easy way to create 
and develop FHIR-compliant servers (the "Software"). The Software is provided by QSI to customers primarily as a convenience at this time. 
The terms of this Agreement will apply to your use of the Software, including any revisions or new releases QSI may provide you at any time.

Terms
License Grant
QSI hereby grants to you, and you accept, a nonexclusive license to use the Software, provided in machine-readable, object-code form, 
only as authorized in this Agreement. No source code will be provided and/or made available to You.

You agree that you will not assign, sublicense, transfer, pledge, lease, rent, or share your rights under this Agreement. 
You agree that you may not reverse assemble, reverse compile or otherwise translate the Software.

You may not rent, lease or lend the Software.

Upon loading the Software into your computer, you may retain, for backup purposes, one copy of the Software. 
Any copies of the Software or any related user documentation shall include QSI's copyright and other proprietary notices. 
Except as authorized under this paragraph, no copies of the Software or any portions thereof may be made by you or any person under your authority or control.

License Fees
The Software is provided without charge. Other fees, if any, are payable only as separately stipulated by QSI and agreed to, in writing, by Customer.

Proprietary Rights
The Software and related user documentation are proprietary products of QSI protected under U.S. copyright law. 
All right, title, and interest in and to the Software, including associated intellectual property rights, are and shall remain with QSI. 
This Agreement does not convey to you an interest in or to the Software, but only a limited right of use revocable in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

Feedback/Submissions
You are asked to report any error or malfunction in the Software to QSI. Although QSI assumes no legal obligation with respect to your use of the Software, 
it is QSI's intent that errors and malfunctions will be addressed through reasonable corrective efforts based on priorities 
and available resources QSI may assign to such errors or malfunctions.

Should you decide to transmit to QSI's Web site by any means or by any media any materials or other information 
(including, without limitation, ideas, concepts or techniques for new or improved services and products), 
whether as information, feedback, data, questions, comments, suggestions or the like, you agree such submissions are unrestricted 
and shall be deemed non-confidential and you automatically grant QSI and its assigns a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, 
perpetual, irrevocable license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, transmit, distribute, create derivative works of, display and perform the same.

Term
This Agreement is effective upon the earlier of your execution of this Agreement or your first use of the Software, 
and shall continue until terminated. QSI may terminate this Agreement upon 30 days prior notice at any time, or immediately in the event of any breach by you of any term hereof. Upon any termination, you agree to return to QSI the Software and all copies and portions thereof or certify permanent deletion of all copies of the Software within your control.

Backward compatibility of future releases, if any, is not guaranteed.

Please remember that any use of computers is subject to a likelihood of human and machine errors, omissions, delays and losses, 
including loss or corruption of data or media. You should adopt such measures as you believe proper to limit the impact of those problems, 
including backing up data and verifying the accuracy of input data; examining and confirming results prior to use; and adopting procedures to identify and correct errors and omissions, replace lost or damaged media, and reconstruct data.

Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or special damages, 
or the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on how long a given warranty may last, so the above limitations may not apply to you.
